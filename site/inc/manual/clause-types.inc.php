<p>CCGrebank distinguishes different subtypes of the basic S category with
features: <code>[ng]</code> for present participle, <code>[pt]</code> for past
participle, <code>[dcl]</code> for indicative, <code>[b]</code> for infinitive
and imperative, <code>[to]</code> for <i>to</i>-infinitive, <code>[q]</code>
for yes/no questions, <code>[wq]</code> for <i>wh</i>-questions,
<code>[em]</code> for embedded clauses and <code>[intj]</code> for
interjections.</p>

<p>Although this feature set is designed for English and additional
distinctions would make sense for other languages (for example, main vs.
subordinate clause for German and Dutch), the features can in most cases be
applied to our target languages, and we stick with the existing feature set for
now.</p>

<p>VP and S modifiers are underspecified for the clause type they modify, using
just plain <code>S</code> categories.</p>

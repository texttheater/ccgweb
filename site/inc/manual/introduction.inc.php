<p>This is an effort to build a multilingual corpus of CCG annotations for
evaluating derivation projection algorithms and cross-lingually trained
parsers.</p>

<p>We opt here for a flavor of CCG closely following <a
href=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1858703>CCGrebank</a>. The reason for
this choice is that a large volume of training data in this format (for
English) is available. Having test data (in multiple languages) in a similar
format will enable a direct comparison.</p>

<p>Of course, the annotation format for CCGrebank has only been specified for
English. It is not always obvious how to apply it to other languages. This
continually growing manual gives guidelines, alphabetically sorted by the
linguistic phenomenon in question.</p>
